            Mark Zuckerberg once said, <em>“People don’t care about what you say, they care about what you build.”</em> In our society as it is today, software and technology is essential. So, what is the importance of software in everyday life? Did you check your phone this morning? When you woke up which appliances did you use, and did you drive your car to work? According to RMIT university, there are around 37,761 active software positions open to Australians. This demand proves the complete and utter reliance on technology that society has.
        <br><br>
        Again, Zuckerberg can be quoted saying, <em>“Find that thing you are super passionate about”.</em> For me it is the endless possibilities that software offers. The ability to influence society in enormous ways. Without the use of software, every single little bit of administration etc. must be done manually and on paper. In review, this will affect many things such as the environment, and thus would be very detrimental to our future, but back to software.
        <br><br>
        The future is a software programmed one. Numerous experts say that digital life will continue to expand people’s boundaries and opportunities. I will be apart of this as my future and passions parallel. A puzzle, software engineering poses an unanswered call to which no answer will ever be complete. This intrigues me, like a never-ending jigsaw puzzle with alternating patterns and images and ways to fill the space. Zuckerberg explained how “Facebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission to make the world more open and corrected”, and I think this is what I seek. This compatibility with the majority of the software which make our world go round. I want be involved in what I believe is the biggest addition to our world which mankind will ever create.
        <br><br>
        Looking towards the future I want to aim big. Specifically, I will aim for a position within the esteemed ‘Google’ company, founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Page and Brin are computer scientists and internet entrepreneurs. No two tech executives are said to be quite as enigmatic yet private as the google co-founders. What they created will most likely last far into the future and I want to be apart of this. Every software engineer has thought at one time or another about what breaking free and risking entrepreneurship. What will this accomplish? Could I possibly design something to which society becomes reliant on? Something which mirrors the good Google did for society, because after all, Facebook began in a garage.
        <br><br><br>
        I am limited only by my imagination.
